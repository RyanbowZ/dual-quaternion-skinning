Completed all of the tasks and bonus except for the GPU Skinning part.

Enabled new data from mixamo.com <folder name: data2>.
To switch between the bind pose (by default) and animation mode, you should press space key.
To switch between the Dual Quaternion Skinning (DQS) and Linear Blend Skinning (LBS, by default) way, you should first enter the animation mode and press 'd' key.
Avoided long-way quaternion blending by checking dot product between non-dual parts of dual quaternions, if it is negative then negate the dual quaternions.
Reorganized the code and optimized coding style as much as possible, unless there is not necessity or need to do so (when you separate them, you would face larger complexity or longer codes).
Please do not try to switch face texture when using new data from mixamo.com
